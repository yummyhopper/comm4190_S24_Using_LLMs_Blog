    "The problem of AI laziness is really a problem of human laziness, but one that developers have to account for. With a little more effortful prompting it would not be difficult for any of the models to deliver an optimal result, but that's not the AI dream for many users. We are cognitive misers with brains designed to search for solutions that minimize effort while maximizing results, but we don't want our AI systems to behave the same way. Rather OpenAI's common user wants to give the least possible input and receive a maximally polished result. This means creating action oriented models designed to interpret simple prompts and infer several layers of extrapolation and nuance to deliver the desired result. Whether frontier AI companies choose to cater to the laziness of the mass rather than creating more nuanced and specialized systems that produce higher quality responses to higher quality prompts can be debated. What's became clear from this dilemma is that there's more that goes into a general purpose model than how well it scores on an SAT, the sheer size of its context window, or its fancy new name. To quote Janet Jackson \"What have you done for me lately?\" The most commercially viable AI systems will tend towards prioritizing user experience, whether that comes at the expense of accuracy or another measure remains to be seen."
