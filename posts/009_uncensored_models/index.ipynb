    "### The Case For Uncensored AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In his article (https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models) \"Uncensored Models\" Eric Hartford gives four reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. American popular culture isn't the only culture.\n",
    "   - This is the ethos behind much of the open-source movement more generally. Everyone should have their own AI systems without the biases of whatever tech giant is behind the frontier model\n",
    "2. Alignment interferes with valid use cases.\n",
    "   - Some of the best novels of all time involve evil characters who do horrible things. Censored AI doesn't know what to do with that and other use cases are imaginable.\n",
    "3. It's my computer, it should do what I want.\n",
    "   - Things should do what they're designed to do. LLMs are designed to answer my questions. I don't want the model to argue with me.\n",
    "4. Composable alignment\n",
    "   - Without an unaligned base, we have nothing to build alignment on top of for tailored open-source models.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I'll ad a fifth point on for Uncensored AI. It's really fun and easy to use. I ran llama2-uncensored locally from my surface pro laptop and made it say all sorts of crazy shit, not all of which I will detail here. That being said, here's one example of it's potty-mouthed powers using llama2-uncensored:"

    "### This can't be a good thing\n",
    "\n",
    "While Hartford writes \"If you are simply and utterly against the existence or availability of uncensored models whatsoever, then you aren't a very interesting, nuanced, or complex person.\" I think he does an unsatisfactory job at showing the nuance of the issue. Namely, I think he either fails to consider or disregards the problem of powerful chatbots producing clearly unethical material such as how to make a bomb, how to commit suicide, and producing CSAM material. While it's true that there's a lot of value to be gained from open-source models being fine-tuned for a particular culture/job, we need to do this conscious of the very real existential risks from AI. AI does not have freedom of speech, it is not endowed with certain unalienable rights. It is a tool that we need to use consciously and intelligently. After much reflection, here are some counter-points on why uncensored models may not be as good an idea as they seem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Source Models are getting stronger, the ones today will not be the best ones at producing unethical material. While the LLMs of today may not seem particularly scary tomorrow's LLMs will be able to complete tasks faster and better than those today. This could mean more convincing misinformation campaigns, more specific and actionable instructions to create bioweapons, and more graphic CSAM material. \n",
    "2. Bad actors will seek uncensored models out. Even if uncensored models seem niche and unthreatening their mere existence will draw the attention of all sorts of users with malicious intentions. People who want to use an LLM to help them build a bomb or create a misinformation campaign won't struggle against the guidelines of censored models they'll just find an uncensored model that can get the job done without any backtalk.\n",
    "3. There are some things that should be off limits for anyone. No matter what culture or use case there is CSAM, misinformation, and safety hazards are not OK. While moderators may make mistakes and often do the harms that  can be caused by not having any moderation far outweigh the good things that can come out of this. Responsible use for this powerful of a technology is not something we should be taken lightly and while you may disagree with some decisions being made the \"anything goes\" mentality is simply inconsiderate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to acknowledge that the development and regulation of AI technologies are not solely matters of academic or intellectual curiosity; they involve real-world implications that can affect lives and communities in profound ways. As such, it is not enough to advocate for the advancement of AI without simultaneously considering the safeguards necessary to prevent its exploitation for unethical purposes. The responsibility lies not just in harnessing AI's potential for good but also in actively preventing its use for harm. Reflecting on the points raised, it becomes clear that while AI has the potential to bring about significant advancements and benefits, this potential must be balanced with rigorous ethical considerations and robust oversight mechanisms. The goal should be to foster an environment where AI can thrive as a force for good, guided by principles that ensure its ethical use and mitigate risks. "
