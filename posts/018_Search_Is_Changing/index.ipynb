    "AI and Search are both question-answering machines. Until recently Google had the best question-answering machine, gathering a dominant 90% market share amongst search engines. However AI has challenged this stranglehold by answering questions in new ways. AI can generate more personalized results, reason in multiple steps, and learn through many different modalities. Plain old Google is no longer the best question-answering machine and the company has just made a major move to address it's shiny new competition. This paradigm shift signals a major change for those in the business of providing answers, particularly SEO marketers. So, what does this mean for the evolving landscape of SEO, will you lose valuable clicks,and what can you do about it?\n",

    "> “When search grows up, it will look like Star Trek: you talk into the air (“Computer! What’s the situation down on the planet?”) and the computer processes your question, figures out its context, figures out what response you’re looking for, searches a giant database in who-knows-how-many languages, translates/analyses/summarises all the results, and presents them back to you in a pleasant voice. I think this technology is about, oh, 300 years off.” - *Craig Silverstein, Google CTO (2003)*\n",
