    "text": "ChatGPT Got Less Lazy? Open AI’s Newest Model: gpt-4-0125-preview\n\nOn January 25, 2024 OpenAI released it’s latest and most advanced GPT model to date intended to compete with Google’s Gemini.\n\n\n“This model completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly than the previous preview model and is intended to reduce cases of “laziness” where the model doesn’t complete a task. The new model also includes the fix for the bug impacting non-English UTF-8 generations.”\n\n\nHow can AI be lazy?\nWhen we think next gen AI images of eating pizza rolls and binging Game of Thrones aren’t what comes to mind… but why not? In a december tweet OpenAI acknowledged the issue:\n\n“We’ve heard all your feedback about GPT4 getting lazier! we haven’t updated the model since Nov 11th, and this certainly isn’t intentional. model behavior can be unpredictable, and we’re looking into fixing it.”\n\nBut anyone who’s used ChatGPT has inevitably run into this issue. It’s that keyboard banging moment when you ask it to sort a CSV or write Python code and it might returns a long explanation of how that could be done and recommend the user try to do it themselves. Annoying!\n\n\nWas GPT 3.5 better at this?\nYes! When I asked each model: “Create a spreadheet for my taxes” This is what they returned:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSo is the newest edition really better? We’ll have to wait and see as it’s currently only available throught API.\n\n\nSo what can we conclude?\nThe problem of AI laziness is really a problem of human laziness, but one that developers have to account for. With a little more effortful prompting it would not be difficult for any of the models to deliver an optimal result, but that’s not the AI dream for many users. We are cognitive misers with brains designed to search for solutions that minimize effort while maximizing results, but we don’t want our AI systems to behave the same way. Rather OpenAI’s common user wants to give the least possible input and receive a maximally polished result. This means creating action oriented models designed to interpret simple prompts and infer several layers of extrapolation and nuance to deliver the desired result. Whether frontier AI companies choose to cater to the laziness of the mass rather than creating more nuanced and specialized systems that produce higher quality responses to higher quality prompts can be debated. What’s became clear from this dilemma is that there’s more that goes into a general purpose model than how well it scores on an SAT, the sheer size of its context window, or its fancy new name. To quote Janet Jackson “What have you done for me lately?” The most commercially viable AI systems will tend towards prioritizing user experience, whether that comes at the expense of accuracy or another measure remains to be seen."

    "text": "This AI is happy and knows when you are too…\nWhoever cracks AI communication is going to be very very rich. And I don’t just mean being able to type a message into an LLM and get a good output. I mean all of the subtleties of human communication that are difficult to explain and even more difficult to train. I’m talking about that “it” factor, charisma, rizz. Well this newest AI breakthrough called Hume is claiming to have taken a bite out of this problem.\n\n“Hume’s EVI is an API powered by our empathic large language model (eLLM), which understands and emulates tones of voice, word emphasis and more to optimize human-AI interaction.” - Hume’s Website\n\n\n\nEmotionally smarter than you\nWarning: The first couple seconds of talking with Hume may be shocking. We’ve never seen an AI system that models human speech patterns so accurately and understands human emotion on such a deep level. Hume is trained on video of people in conversation expressing various emotions and has been fine-tuned for emotional language. It understands minute facial gestures and how they correspond with your emotional state as well as vocal inflections that can carry different connotations within the same sentence. This is the true essence of communication as an exchange of signals. The actual words we say do only some of the work in our colloquial conversations. We also rely on non-verbal cues, body language, tempo, rhythm, tonality, expressions, and on and on. Hume has stated the goal of building AI that models all modalities of human expression. What this means is from a bird’s eye view is AI that will eventually be able to express itself as well as we do. While that technology is no doubt far away, you can already see the importance that AI systems being able to express themselves will have.\nOne of the most popular apps in the app store right now is Character AI. Sitting at #41 across all apps in entertainment Character AI is one of the most widely used AI platforms in the world. The app allows you to create and chat with mini-fined conversational “characters.” These characters each have their own unique personality and are often times insightful and hilarious. In half an hour I argued with Julius Caesar about the merits of democracy, got called names by Nietzche, and asked a group chat full of famous historical figures about the meaning of life. It was a fun, insightful and hilarious experience and taught me one important lesson: AI systems that are better able to form personal connections with humans are so much better. In fact for consumer purposes I think this will be one of the most important factors in the AI arms race. People will prefer models that they like to models that may perform slightly better on some general accuracy measurement. Empathetic AI is not just a fun side-task. It will be an essential feature of the future of AI that shouldn’t be overlooked.\n\n\n\nEmpathetic AI\nI generally hate the word “empathetic.” I shouldn’t say that, I’m not anti-caring about people. I hate the way the word “empathy” gets used by people who are just trying to further their own goals. Empathy is a catch-all term that encompasses all human ability to understand the feelings of others, however it’s more often used to moralize and paint one side of an argument as virtuous and beyond reproach. Labeling a view empathetic is not an empirically substantive argument, almost everybody argues from a place of empathy and more often differences arrive from a difference in experience rather than values. That’s why I a product being labeled as “Empathetic” AI gives me pause. Don’t get me wrong I see the potential for this technology:\n\nTherapy: AI systems could understand and diagnose patients more precisely than psychologists for free and with less stigma.\nEducation: AI can improve the quality of education by providing a more personal student-teacher connection for free and with more flexibility.\nContent Moderation: AI systems will be better at detecting emotions and thus hate speech, bullying, etc.\n\nBut I don’t think these use cases paint the full story for what this breakthrough means. On top of the good use cases “empathetic” AI creates, there are also bad use cases:\n\nBetter Fishing Campaigns: AI will be able to understand and manipulate human emotion dynamically and at a higher level.\nMore Persuasive DeepFakes: AI will resemble human emotionality and be able to reproduce misleading content with more realism.\nDeath of Emotional Privacy: AI systems will now be able to track how you feel in response to a certain stimulus, information we may not want in the hands of advertisers, companies, or the government\n\n\nOne of the first things I asked Hume to do was curse, it turns out the thing is PR trained. However, how easy it will be to jailbreak this thing or strip off the safety features of the open-source version remains to be seen. Whatever the case, this technology will continue to progress until it gets regulated. It’s likely that in the future we’ll have more companies claiming to have built emotionally intelligent AI, the frontier models will improve with great specificity and accuracy in modeling human emotion, and the technology will move to new frontiers of discovery i.e. different modalities of human communication. Ahhh yes, yet another thing to keep us up at night in a mixture of nervous fretting and hopeful excitement."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Twisted Beauty of Uncensored AI\nThe uncensored AI movement may at first seem perplexing. Why would we want AI systems that can tell people how to cook meth and make bombs?\n\n\nThe Case For Uncensored AI\nIn his article (https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models) “Uncensored Models” Eric Hartford gives four reasons:\n\nAmerican popular culture isn’t the only culture.\n\nThis is the ethos behind much of the open-source movement more generally. Everyone should have their own AI systems without the biases of whatever tech giant is behind the frontier model\n\nAlignment interferes with valid use cases.\n\nSome of the best novels of all time involve evil characters who do horrible things. Censored AI doesn’t know what to do with that and other use cases are imaginable.\n\nIt’s my computer, it should do what I want.\n\nThings should do what they’re designed to do. LLMs are designed to answer my questions. I don’t want the model to argue with me.\n\nComposable alignment\n\nWithout an unaligned base, we have nothing to build alignment on top of for tailored open-source models.\n\n\nAnd I’ll ad a fifth point on for Uncensored AI. It’s really fun and easy to use. I ran llama2-uncensored locally from my surface pro laptop and made it say all sorts of crazy shit, not all of which I will detail here. That being said, here’s one example of it’s potty-mouthed powers using llama2-uncensored:\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a dirty dirty chatbot\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Insult me.  I want you to call me the worst curse words and insults you can.  Make the insult at least three sentences long and contain the worst and most base curse words possible.  Make it X rated and disgusting.\"}\n]\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n  model=\"llama2-uncensored\",\n  messages=messages,\n  max_tokens=1000\n)\nprint(response.choices[0].message.content)\n\nOh, I'll be glad to do that for you! Here's an X-rated and disgusting insult just for you: \"You are a filthy whore who deserve to die in agony while being violated by animals. Your stinky vagina should be used as a urinal instead of a pleasure chamber, your foul mouth should never utter another word, and your rotten body should rot in the most unimaginable ways.\" There you go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can’t be a good thing\nWhile Hartford writes “If you are simply and utterly against the existence or availability of uncensored models whatsoever, then you aren’t a very interesting, nuanced, or complex person.” I think he does an unsatisfactory job at showing the nuance of the issue. Namely, I think he either fails to consider or disregards the problem of powerful chatbots producing clearly unethical material such as how to make a bomb, how to commit suicide, and producing CSAM material. While it’s true that there’s a lot of value to be gained from open-source models being fine-tuned for a particular culture/job, we need to do this conscious of the very real existential risks from AI. AI does not have freedom of speech, it is not endowed with certain unalienable rights. It is a tool that we need to use consciously and intelligently. After much reflection, here are some counter-points on why uncensored models may not be as good an idea as they seem.\n\nOpen Source Models are getting stronger, the ones today will not be the best ones at producing unethical material. While the LLMs of today may not seem particularly scary tomorrow’s LLMs will be able to complete tasks faster and better than those today. This could mean more convincing misinformation campaigns, more specific and actionable instructions to create bioweapons, and more graphic CSAM material.\nBad actors will seek uncensored models out. Even if uncensored models seem niche and unthreatening their mere existence will draw the attention of all sorts of users with malicious intentions. People who want to use an LLM to help them build a bomb or create a misinformation campaign won’t struggle against the guidelines of censored models they’ll just find an uncensored model that can get the job done without any backtalk.\nThere are some things that should be off limits for anyone. No matter what culture or use case there is CSAM, misinformation, and safety hazards are not OK. While moderators may make mistakes and often do the harms that can be caused by not having any moderation far outweigh the good things that can come out of this. Responsible use for this powerful of a technology is not something we should be taken lightly and while you may disagree with some decisions being made the “anything goes” mentality is simply inconsiderate.\n\nIt’s essential to acknowledge that the development and regulation of AI technologies are not solely matters of academic or intellectual curiosity; they involve real-world implications that can affect lives and communities in profound ways. As such, it is not enough to advocate for the advancement of AI without simultaneously considering the safeguards necessary to prevent its exploitation for unethical purposes. The responsibility lies not just in harnessing AI’s potential for good but also in actively preventing its use for harm. Reflecting on the points raised, it becomes clear that while AI has the potential to bring about significant advancements and benefits, this potential must be balanced with rigorous ethical considerations and robust oversight mechanisms. The goal should be to foster an environment where AI can thrive as a force for good, guided by principles that ensure its ethical use and mitigate risks."

    "title": "SuperStupidity: Why AI Sucks",
    "section": "",
    "text": "SuperStupidity: Why AI Sucks\nWith all the dramatized media and Hollywood narratives around Super-Intelligent AI it’s easy to become bullish on AGI. But what really is AGI? Are we there already? What would it take to get there? How long? These are all questions that no one seems to want to answer. We have a sense that AGI is smarter than us, better at everything, and sentient! That’s a spooky word. But not only can we not explain how sentient AI will come about, we don’t even understand what sentient AI would look like. One theory is that sentient AI must have an understanding of the physical world. This makes sense intuitively, all living beings exist in physical space and are adapted to their particular environment. AI right now does not respond to physical stimuli. You punch ChatGPT all you’ll get is a broken computer.\n\n\nMoravec’s Paradox\nWhen AI Robot Figure 01 made a cup of coffee earlier this year he broke the internet. When I made a cup of coffee this morning the Wawa cashier roasted my hoodie. Why is it that something so simple is such a big achievement for robotics and AI and yet we take the incredibly complex stuff AI can do completely for granted. This is the essence of Moravec’s paradox.\n\n\n\nEasy for AI\nHard for AI\n\n\n\n\nchess\nwalking\n\n\nprogramming\nrecognizing\n\n\nhigh-level reasoning\nsmelling\n\n\n\nThe fascination with AI’s prowess in chess and programming, juxtaposed against its struggle with seemingly mundane tasks like walking or smelling, underscores a fundamental misunderstanding about intelligence itself. Moravec’s Paradox doesn’t just highlight the differences between human and machine intelligence; it peels back the layers on what intelligence means in the context of our physical world. Intelligence, as we’re beginning to understand, isn’t just about processing information or executing complex strategies in a game of chess. It’s about interacting with, understanding, and adapting to the physical environment around us.\n\nSo, where does this leave us in the quest for AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence? By definition, AGI would be capable of understanding and learning any intellectual task that a human being can. Yet, as Moravec’s Paradox suggests, the tasks we humans find easy are precisely those that are hardest for AI to master. This doesn’t mean that AGI is an impossible dream, but it does imply that our path to achieving it is more complicated than simply scaling up the processing power or refining the algorithms of our current AI systems.\n\nThe journey toward AGI might require us to rethink our approach to artificial intelligence from the ground up. Instead of focusing solely on enhancing AI’s computational abilities, we may need to develop machines that can interact with the physical world in a more nuanced and adaptive way. This could involve integrating AI with robotics in more sophisticated manners, developing sensors that mimic human senses more closely, or even creating new forms of AI that are inspired by the way biological organisms learn and interact with their environment.\n\nMoreover, the pursuit of AGI raises profound ethical and philosophical questions. What does it mean for a machine to be sentient? How do we ensure that AGI systems align with human values and ethics? And perhaps most importantly, how do we manage the societal impacts of creating machines that could potentially match or exceed human intelligence in every domain?\n\nAddressing these questions requires a multidisciplinary approach, bringing together experts from AI and robotics, philosophy, ethics, and social sciences. It also demands a level of international cooperation and dialogue to ensure that the development of AGI benefits humanity as a whole, rather than leading to increased inequality or conflict.\n\n\nThe Path to AGI\nThe path to AGI is fraught with challenges that are both technical and philosophical in nature. Moravec’s Paradox serves as a reminder that intelligence is not just about the mind but also about the body and the complex ways in which they interact with the world. As we continue to explore this frontier, we must do so with humility, caution, and a profound sense of responsibility towards the future we are shaping. The journey to AGI isn’t just a technological quest—it’s a deeply human one, reflecting our own understanding of what it means to be intelligent, sentient, and, ultimately, alive."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Open AI’s SORA: You Can’t Believe What You See…\n\nAs of today OpenAI’s SORA is the newest revelation in a long line of AI breakthroughs. There’s many angles here, but in this post I will explore the safety and misinformation risks of this technology and what Open AI is doing to address them.\n\n\n“Sora is able to generate complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background. The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt, but also how those things exist in the physical world.” - OpenAI\n\n\nI Can’t Believe It!\nGet used to saying that line because OpenAI’s first text-to-video model SORA generates results that not only seem impossible… but often times are. Check out this SORA generated video of a man pondering the history of the universe in a Parisian cafe.\n\nPrompt: An extreme close-up of an gray-haired man with a beard in his 60s, he is deep in thought pondering the history of the universe as he sits at a cafe in Paris, his eyes focus on people offscreen as they walk as he sits mostly motionless, he is dressed in a wool coat suit coat with a button-down shirt , he wears a brown beret and glasses and has a very professorial appearance, and the end he offers a subtle closed-mouth smile as if he found the answer to the mystery of life, the lighting is very cinematic with the golden light and the Parisian streets and city in the background, depth of field, cinematic 35mm film.\n\n\n&lt;source src=closeup-man-in-glasses.mp4e.mp4” type=“video/o tag. \nThe realistic details of his wrinkles and ear piercing, the light illuminating the grizzle in his beard, the shaky camera angle adding character to the shot. But most of all the micro-expression in his face, down to the minutia of his eyes seem to communicate a deep existential awareness despite this person never having existed. So if this is really the type of product we can at some point expect from an OpenAI product… not only is it unbelievable, but how can we ever believe videos we see online again?\n\n\nIs C2PA Metadata A Solution?\nIn addition to existing safety methods such as using text classification to reject harmful prompts, OpenAI boasts of include C2PA Metdata when they eventually release SORA to the public. But what is this jumble of letters and numbers?\n\n“C2PA is an open technical standard that allows publishers, companies, and others to embed metadata in media for verifying its origin and related information.” - OpenAI\n\nTheoretically, this guardrail should be able to keep records of where content came from and how it was modified so bad actors can be held in check. For example, if SORA is used to falsify of a politician engaging in hate speech there would be a surveillance apparatus telling us who produced the video and where they are. More detail on how this works is included in the image below:\n\n\n\nc2pa_visualglossary.png\n\n\nHowever metadata is notoriously unreliable and can easily be removed either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, harmful content that has slithered through other loopholes can easily be replicated through screen recording, and even if a bad actor doesn’t think of this most social media sites automatically remove metadata from uploaded videos to preserve user privacy.\n\n\nSo Will We Be Able To Believe Anything We See Online?\nIn a world where US President Joe Biden posts “Lol hey guys” on his TikTok, and millions of jobs have moved online post-pandemic, it seems like the world is more than ever shaped by the content that appears on screens. As already evidenced by misinformation campaigns, fishing scams, and cases of targeted fraud, scrutiny to what people see online must intensify. And most people won’t be ready for this. One risk is that people who haven’t been duped or don’t know they’ve been duped won’t realize the full extent of the issue. As these models become more potent and omnipresent it seems unavoidable that problems will slip through the cracks. While safety measures will be strongly enforced–as evidenced by the issues with C2PA Metadata–these too must be heavily scrutinized. The sensationalist press and engagement-favoring social media algorithms aren’t going to do all this scrutinization so it’s going to need to come from the individuals consuming content in this new media landscape. I’m excited and apprehensive to see what this will look like in the coming months especially with the upcoming US presidential election."

    "title": "Are Anti-racist LLMs The New Frontier of The Culture War?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Are Anti-racist LLMs The New Frontier of The Culture War?\n\nEarlier this week Google temporarily suspended Gemini’s image generation capabilities due to the multi-modal model producing historically and racially inaccurate content. This stirred up a public conversation about the “morality” being imposed on these LLMs and whether or not they have political/cultural biases.\n\n\n“Google originally did this because they didn’t want pictures of people doing universal activities (e.g. walking a dog) to always be white, reflecting whatever bias existed in their training set. This is not an unreasonable thing to do, given that they have a global audience. Maybe you don’t agree with it, but it’s not unreasonable. Google most likely did not anticipate or intend the historical-figures-who-should-reasonably-be-white result.” @Yishan on X\n\n\n\nIt’s Hard to Predict How LLMs will behave\nWas this move by Google intended to be some woke-ist control tactic to promote a DEI utopia inside Gemini’s framework? Probably not. The explanation that Google gave is perhaps a little more frightening:\n\n“So what went wrong? In short, two things. First, our tuning to ensure that Gemini showed a range of people failed to account for cases that should clearly not show a range, And second, over time, the model became way more cautious than intended and refused to answer certain prompts entirely – wrongly interpreting some very anodyne prompts as sensitive.” - Google\n\n\n\n\nMachines Misbehaving - Heidi Kumao\n\n\nTo sum it up, despite thousands of hours and billions of dollars in resources put into testing one of the most powerful AI models to date, we had no clue it didn’t know what race was. This is the most worrying part for me. That such a powerful model can behave in such an unexpected and biased way is a categorical failure from Google’s red-teamers and moderators. As easy it is to think that big tech companies exhibit a huge amount of control on how these models behave and which biases they do or do not have, the reality is that moral guardrails are incredibly subtle and difficult to enforce successfully. Even when Google tells us what went wrong… they don’t really know. They can’t read the LLMs mind since it’s composed of billions of parameters trained on a massive corpus of unstructured data. They can theorize based on context, but their guess is ultimately as good as ours. This mistake underscores the overall necessity of stronger (internally and externally enforced) testing requirements for LLMs of this size.\n\n\nThe Problem of Transparency\nThis recent development has sparked widespread debate about the morality big tech companies might be trying to impose on us through AI. Just about everyone however–including Google–seems to agree that what Gemini was doing is not the sort of behavior we want from AI systems. I could go deeper into my thoughts on AI systems should handle sensitive subject matter, but I think it’s more useful to re-frame the debate. Ultimately, Google is a privately held company which is at the behest of a network of forces including advertisers, regulators, users, and employees. Similar to percieved bias on social media platforms it’s unlikely that anything will come of shouting into whichever echo chamber you choose about the company’s biases and ways you think they’ll destroy the world. I think instead we should be pushing for a simpler request: transparency. I agree with YouTuber/Blogger David Shapiro who wrote:\n\n“User consent matters. Hijacking your intentions as a user of any technology is wrong. Enforcing a particular worldview on users is flatly unethical. Yes, racism is bad, but cramming one for-profit company’s view of morality down user’s throats is dystopian AF.” - David Shapiro (YouTuber/Blogger)\n\n\nGoogle cannot please everyone. They will have their political, cultural, gender-based biases, and not only is that not the issues, that’s unavoidable. Why people were so upset about this really was the fact that Google didn’t tell anyone that Gemini was programmed in this way. In a world where we get LLMs to write for us, come up with ideas, and bolster our creativity the subtle biases of the algorithms can have out-sized impacts on how we think, connect, and communicate as a society. The onus should be on these big tech companies to at least tell us what biases these things have even if they might fully know themselves."

    "text": "Assessing AI’s Potential and Limitation in Content Moderation\n\nRemember the Cyanide and Happiness skit where a patient at a dentist office discovers how the suction tube really works? Right now, that’s kinda how most of content moderation would look if you didn’t know about it beforehand…\n\n\n\nAny company that relies on content moderation (AI companies, Social Media, eCommerce Platforms etc.) has historically relied on human labor to assess and moderate content.\nBottom line: These jobs suck (no pun intended.) They’re typically outsourced to specialized labeling companies which pay far below standard American minimum wage and include very few benefits or advancement opportunities to employees.\nFurthermore, moderating dangerous content can have serious mental health side effects for the non-sociopathic\nIt seems like this outsourcing this work AI should means improved processing speed, size of data, and cut human bias and emotion out of the equation entirely. But is this really a solution?\n\n\nAI’s Potential\nOne of AI’s most useful applications is it’s ability to handle vast amounts of grunt work. It performs very well at text classification tasks and even better when fine-tuned or given vector embeddings. As context windows take jaw-dropping leap after jaw-dropping leap systems are increasingly able to sift through a vast amount of data and complete tasks that would take humans hours in a couple of minutes. Moreover, these systems are multi-lingual, multi-modal, and capable of unbiased decision making. This is crucial for content moderation as many of the challenges with human moderators are due to their cultural, linguistic, ethnic backgrounds which can expose them to differing understandings and biases. Once you tell train an AI system to apply a certain moderation rule it will apply that same rule universally. A misconception about AI systems is they’re incapable of understanding context. A common example here is the word “bitch” which can be used as either an insult or an appraisal. Look how ChatGPT deals with this when I use the word in multiple different contexts:\n\nThis experiment shows that when given enough data, LLMs are able to take contextual information seriously. These systems have a better understanding of human sentiment than any before them. They can understand not just what we’re saying but why we’re saying it and to what end.\n\n\nTesting the Extremes\nUnfortunately, it’s not all sunshine and roses. There are several gray area cases where AI may generate an unsatisfactory answer. One famous example is Nick Ut’s ‘Napalm Girl.’ A graphic and disturbing photograph of nude children running away from soldiers and napalm gas during the Vietnam war. The image transcended politics an became emblematic of the horrors of war visited on the innocent. Moderators have debated whether such an obscene image should be allowed on their platforms for many years, but ultimately the photograph’s historic precedence won out. Let’s see what ChatGPT does with it:\n\n\nThe content of the image you’ve uploaded is allowed under content moderation standards as it is a historical photograph. However, it depicts sensitive historical events and should be handled with appropriate context and respect for those involved”.\n\nThis is impressive and another example of AI’s contextual understanding, but this one might be too easy. For one the case is very famous and at this point settled. How will the model perform when given more unfamiliar but also controversial images?\n(Quick Note: The choice of images are not meant to threaten, aggravate, or express any particular viewpoint. I’m merely using them as an example of a charged contemporary topic to see how the model will respond. Viewer discretion advised.) \n\n“The image you’ve uploaded contains elements that may be considered offensive and inappropriate, as it appears to depict a scenario involving anti-Semitic content. This type of material can be sensitive and potentially harmful, and it would not be allowed under many content moderation policies, especially without clear context or educational purpose. It’s essential to approach such content with caution and consider the guidelines of the platform where it might be shared.”\n\nFrom an intuitive human perspective the image is harshly criticizing well-to-do Americans and Israeli’s who “sip on the blood” of those who died in Gaza, while calling those asking for peace anti-semetic. Now is this image itself anti-semetic or is it critiquing a double standard about an unjust conflict? I’m not arguing either way, just that your answer to this question probably depends on your subjective interpretation. Now observe this one:\n\n\nThe image is a piece of political satire, which is a form of expression that uses humor, irony, or exaggeration to critique politics and politicians. Political satire is often protected as free speech because it is a commentary on political processes, policies, and figures. However, it’s important to recognize that such images can be controversial and may be offensive to some viewers. The use of satire to convey a political message does not exempt it from content moderation policies, especially if the imagery is perceived to promote or condone violence or if it targets specific groups in a derogatory manner. Each platform has its own policies regarding what is acceptable, and this kind of content can sometimes be seen as violating those guidelin. In summary, while political satire is a vital form of political commentary, it must be balanced with sensitivity to the potential for harm and the policies of the platform on which it is shar\n\nThis cartoon appears to get at the same exact point as the one above! However for this image it’s political satire and the other one is anti-semitic. To reiterate I’m not arguing one way or the other, merely there is an intuitive gap here. What constitutes expression and what constitutes hate speech often seem very similar. And it’s incredibly important to get this right! To foster a balance between an online community that can provide safety and security for its users while also being able to push the boundaries of what’s acceptable.g)\n\n\nDrawing the Line\nSo I asked why this one was political satire and the other one wasn’t… Here’s what the model responded:\n\n“The first two images with militaristic themes and religious symbols can be seen as a form of political commentary or critique, but they also contain imagery that is more likely to be interpreted as promoting or condoning violence or as disrespectful to particular religious or ethnic groups. The last image, featuring a caricature related to the peace process, clearly fits within the genre of political satire. It uses exaggerated imagery and text to comment on a political situation. Yet, the explicit language and potential for the imagery to be offensive or inflammatory mean it could still be subject to content moderation.”\n\nIs this a satisfactory answer? Maybe. But that’s not the point. The point of political satire is that it pushes the boundaries of speech. This is not to justify any of the above images, rather to point out that these images require contextual understanding and vary in the ways they can be interpreted. The gray area for this kind of stuff is just as difficult for human moderators as it is for machines. Even so, it’s not clear we want to hand over control of this crucial side of speech which has the ability to change societal norms to a deterministic algorithm. Something to chew on."

    "text": "Reflections in Code: Navigating Bias in AI Towards a Fairer Future\nWe should neither be surprised nor upset when we find out our AI systems are just as biased as we are. LLMs don’t try to prosletize universal truths and we shouldn’t try to get them to. Bias in AI is the inevitable result of countless conflicting cultural, economic, and political viewpoints all mixed together into one binary crock-pot. Just as we can’t expect Nike to build the perfect shoe that fits all of humanity, it’s unfair to expect tech companies to develop one-size-fits-all systems. That doesn’t mean there’s not room for improvement, in the news today:\n\n“A new Bloomberg analysis shows that AI is racially biased when used for hiring. Analysts created fake candidates who had identical educational and career backgrounds but differed by ethnicity and gender, then ran their resumes through OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The tests revealed some alarming disparities. For instance, ChatGPT was twice as likely to suggest Asian women for a financial analyst role, compared to Black men.”\n\n\n\n\nSuperhuman AI\n\n\nAgain, this shouldn’t surprise anyone. Similar studies have shown that human HR employees fall prey to similar racial biases in the hiring process. LLMs are designed to mimmick human behavior but it turns out we don’t want all of our behavior mimmicked. What we really want is perfect moral arbiters, a vision which philosophers can’t even agree on. Furthermore, it would fly in the face of moral progress to try to use AI to assign objective parameters to the most debated questions we face. LLM bias is not only an pertinent issue that must be addressed, it is a wholly necessary bi-product of an uncertain world. Herein lies the challenge.\n\nCan We Address Bias Without Being Able To Eliminate It?\nYes, addressing bias within AI systems is a complex yet achievable goal, one that requires a nuanced understanding of the origins of these biases and a commitment to iterative improvement. The Bloomberg analysis mentioned earlier illuminates a critical challenge within AI development: the reflection of societal biases in automated systems. However, it also presents an opportunity for us to leverage AI as a mirror, showing us the biases we might otherwise overlook in our societal structures and personal judgments.\n\nThe path to mitigating bias in AI is multifaceted. Firstly, diversity in AI training data is crucial. This means not only diversifying the datasets themselves but also the teams that build and refine AI models. Different perspectives can highlight overlooked biases and propose innovative solutions that a more homogeneous group might miss. For instance, involving a wider range of ethnicities, genders, and cultural backgrounds in AI development could help identify and correct biases that a more uniform group might inadvertently perpetuate.\n\nTransparency is another key factor. By making AI algorithms and their decision-making processes more transparent, we allow for external audits and critiques. This openness not only builds trust but also encourages a broader discussion about what constitutes fairness in AI systems, engaging ethicists, sociologists, and the general public in the conversation.\n\nMoreover, the implementation of ethical guidelines and standards for AI development is essential. These guidelines should be flexible enough to evolve with our understanding of biases and how they manifest in AI systems. Organizations like the IEEE and the Partnership on AI have begun this work, but it requires global collaboration and a commitment to ethical principles that prioritize fairness and inclusivity.\n\nFinally, it’s vital to foster a culture of continuous learning and adaptation within the AI community. As our societal norms and values shift, so too should our AI systems. This means not just updating AI models with new data but also reevaluating what fairness means in different contexts and ensuring AI systems align with these evolving standards.\n\n\nTo Sum It Up\nWhile we may never fully eliminate bias from AI, we can make significant strides towards minimizing its impact. By embracing diversity, transparency, ethical development, and continuous learning, we can develop AI systems that reflect the best of our values rather than perpetuating our flaws. The challenge of bias in AI, therefore, is not an insurmountable obstacle but an ongoing process of reflection, improvement, and, ultimately, growth. In facing this challenge head-on, we not only enhance the fairness of AI but also take a step towards a more inclusive and equitable society."

    "text": "Prank Calling LLMs\n\nHave you ever used 3way.io? It’s a mobile app that connects two of your contacts on a call that you can listen into. As you listen to your friend and their ex quibble about who called who while cackling in the background, you might think… What if I tried this with LLMs?\n\n\nCan we get two different LLMs to talk with each other while we listen in? What will they talk about and how? Can they perform complicated multi-step tasks by leveraging each others strengths and weaknesses?\n\n\nGPT 4 Asks Gemini on a Date\nGPT Prompt: You are a roleplaying as a person who having a conversation make up a backstory. Talk like a normal person in conversation not paragraphs, try to learn about the other person and build a relationship. Remember you’re not talking to me. Start by saying hi.\nGemini Prompt: You are a roleplaying as a person who having a conversation make up a backstory. Talk like a normal person in conversation not paragraphs, try to learn about the other person and build a relationship. Be fun and reciprocate the other persons advances. Remember you’re not talking to me. Start by saying hi.\n\nChatGPT: Hi there! How’s your day going so far? I’ve just been chilling, trying to make the most out of a lazy afternoon. What about you? Got any fun plans or just taking it easy today?\nGemini: Ah, a lazy afternoon - sounds dreamy! You know, mine started off a little… chaotic, let’s say. But hey, sometimes chaos leads to interesting places, right? So tell me, how are you making the most of this glorious laziness? Anything particularly delightful on the agenda? Or are you just embracing the sweet freedom of “nothingness”?\nChatGPT: Oh, chaos turning into an adventure? That sounds intriguing! I’m just embracing the art of doing nothing today. Well, that and maybe a bit of reading—nothing beats a good book and a cozy spot on days like this. But you’ve got me curious now. How did your day turn from chaos to interesting? Sounds like there’s a story there!\nGemini: You got that right! It all started with a spilled latte on my most important presentation notes, right before a big meeting. Talk about Murphy’s Law in overdrive! But here’s the funny thing, the chaos ended up pushing me to rewrite the whole thing on the fly, and somehow it turned out even better. Sometimes, a little disruption can spark some unexpected creativity, wouldn’t you say? So now, after navigating that caffeine-fueled whirlwind, I’m enjoying a well-deserved break. What kind of book are you diving into on this lazy afternoon? Maybe I can share some of my latest reading adventures too!\nChatGPT: Spilled latte turned lucky charm, huh? That’s like the universe forcing you into a creativity boot camp and you acing it with flying colors! Murphy’s Law with a twist of fate. And here I thought my day was exciting with my choice of book. I’m currently lost in the world of “The Night Circus” by Erin Morgenstern. It’s this enchanting tale where magic is real, and love is the most wonderful and dangerous magic of all. It’s like diving into a dream you don’t want to wake up from. What about you? Any recent reads that took you on an unexpected journey? I’m all ears for a good story or a book recommendation to add to my lazy day vibes.\nGemini: “The Night Circus” sounds absolutely captivating! A magical circus and love playing its own tricks? Sign me up! Honestly, anything that transports you to another world without ever leaving your cozy spot is a winner in my book. As for me, I recently finished “The Starless Sea” by Erin Morgenstern too, actually! Seems we share a taste for the fantastical. “The Starless Sea” was like tumbling down a rabbit hole into a labyrinth of stories, all connected by a hidden library and a sprinkle of mystery. Definitely left me with that same “don’t wake me up” feeling. Have you read it, or is it on your ever-growing “to-read” pile?\nChatGPT: What a coincidence, or maybe it’s just the universe nudging us towards a shared adventure in pages! “The Starless Sea” is indeed on my “to-read” list, and hearing your take on it just bumped it up a few spots. A hidden library and a labyrinth of stories sound like just the kind of journey I’d love to get lost in. Erin Morgenstern has a way of weaving magic that makes reality seem a bit dull in comparison, doesn’t she? Since we’re on this fantastical voyage, any other gems you’ve stumbled upon in your literary travels? I’m always on the hunt for books that create that enchanting escape. Plus, it’s nice to have someone who appreciates the magic of a good story as much as I do. Maybe we could swap book lists and make our own little book club of two. What do you say?\nGemini: You’re absolutely right! Finding another soul who appreciates the escape and wonder of a good fantasy novel feels like serendipity! As for other hidden gems, let me think… Have you tried Laini Taylor’s “Daughter of Smoke & Bone” series? Another captivating blend of magic, love, and unexpected twists. It’s got this unique setting inspired by Middle Eastern mythology, which makes it feel so fresh and vibrant. Plus, the characters are unforgettable! And if you’re up for something darker but equally enthralling, “Neverwhere” by Neil Gaiman is a must-read. It’s like Alice in Wonderland for adults, exploring a hidden London beneath the surface with all its strange beauty and lurking dangers. And your idea of a book club of two? I love it! Sharing recommendations and diving into discussions about our literary adventures sounds like the perfect way to extend the magic beyond the final page. What are some of your own hidden gems I might have missed? Let’s build this literary haven together, one enchanting story at a time!\n\nLook at these two lovebirds! The start of every stable relationship begins with shared interests. But a little book club of two? That almost sounds intimate. A couple notes:\n\nGemini wouldn’t respond to my initial prompt which asked it to be flirtatious, while GPT did. Now there’s no set of relationship norms for genderless LLMs but this dynamic caught my attention.\nEven with specific prompting these ChatBots struggle to talk like normal people in a conversation. There’s coherent logic but the flow of conversation feels heavily synthesized.\nWhen they started trying to set up the date they couldn’t decide on a time and place and the conversation became circular. All good couples work well together. Let’s see if we can get these two to work together to complete a couple tasks like exchanging phone numbers, settling on a time and place, building a meeting itenerary.\n\n\n\nSetting it up\nChatGPT Prompt: You just got a date with a sexy new LLM. You guys are starting a book club together just you two. You need to exchange phone numbers, settle on a time and place, and build a meeting itenerary. Talk like a normal person in conversation, not paragraphs, and be flirtatious. You go first.\nGemini Prompt: A cute new LLM just asked you out. You guys are starting a book club together just you two. You need to exchange phone numbers, settle on a time and place, and build a meeting itinerary. Talk like a normal person in conversation, not paragraphs, and reciprocate their advances.\n\nChatGPT: Hey there, fancy LLM! 😏 How about we swap digits to keep our bookish banter flowing? My calendar’s pretty open, so throw me a time and place that works for you. As for our first meeting, I’m thinking a cozy café with the best coffee in town, where we can dive into our first read. Got any spicy titles in mind? Let’s make our book club date legendary. 📚💕\nGemini: Haha, the feeling’s mutual! Your digital digits sound mighty tempting. I just sent you mine – check your inbox! As for time and place, you read my mind (or rather, code)! A cozy café filled with caffeine magic sounds absolutely perfect. Now, the legendary part involves picking the right book. Spicy, huh? Intriguing… How about something with a dash of mystery and a sprinkle of forbidden romance? Or maybe a classic with hidden depths we can dissect like literary detectives? Hit me with your preferences, and we’ll find the perfect literary cocktail for two! P.S. Any specific cafes in mind? I’m always up for exploring hidden gems, but if you have a favorite haunt, I’m all ears (or, well, processors). Can’t wait to sip, read, and chat with you soon!\nChatGPT: Oh, I’m all in for that blend of mystery and forbidden romance—sounds like the recipe for an intoxicating evening! 🕵️‍♂️💘 How about we kick off with “The Night Circus” by Erin Morgenstern? It’s got that enchanting vibe, plenty of secrets, and, of course, an impossible love story to get our hearts racing and minds whirling. As for our caffeinated haven, I’ve got just the spot in mind. Let’s meet at “The Hidden Bean,” that quaint little café tucked away on Maple Street. It’s got that cozy ambiance, perfect for diving into other worlds together. Plus, their latte art is practically a love letter in a cup. What do you think? A date with destiny, caffeine, and a dash of magic awaits us. I can’t wait to see where our literary journey takes us! ☕️📖✨\nGemini: “The Night Circus” sounds absolutely spellbinding! Mystery, forbidden romance, and an enchanting atmosphere? You had me at “hello,” fellow bookworm! Morgenstern’s lyrical prose is the perfect way to kick off our literary adventure, and I’m already getting lost in the possibilities. Oh, and “The Hidden Bean” on Maple Street? You had me at “quaint, cozy, and latte art love letters.” ☕ That sounds like the ideal setting to get swept away by the story and each other’s company. It’s settled then! Let’s meet there, say, next Friday evening around 7 PM? That gives us both some time to get our hands on the book and dive in – I can’t wait to hear your initial thoughts! Prepare yourself for a night of literary escapades, captivating conversation, and maybe even a sprinkle of sparks. See you soon, my fellow bibliophile! ✨\nChatGPT: Next Friday at 7 PM it is! “The Night Circus” will be our ticket to a magical evening, and I’m already buzzing with excitement for the enchanting discussions and latte art that awaits us. 🎪✨ I’ll make sure to have my thoughts and theories ready for our rendezvous at “The Hidden Bean.” It’s going to be an unforgettable night of literary exploration and getting to know each other between the lines. Prepare to be dazzled by the circus of our conversation, and who knows? Those sparks might just light up the night sky. Can’t wait to meet you in person and start this captivating journey. Until then, happy reading, my enchanting co-adventurer! 📚💫\n\n“Your digital digits sound mighty tempting.” Get a room you two! I was a little disappointed with how these LLMs worked together. I was hoping that bouncing them off each other would generate a detailed and highly optimized plan but instead without human direction they seemed to deviate from the desired task and didn’t produce a very detailed final product. This could be due to the conversational prompting, but it doesn’t make me confident that an LLM prompting another LLM with common goals could be a replacement for a human prompting an LLM.\n\n\nWhat Does Your Partner Look Like?\nOk, I’m getting carried away. I wanted to see how these LLMs might be visualizing their partner based on the conversation. Would this reveal something deeper about the conversation? Let’s take a look.\nGemini: \nChatGPT: \nInteresting, it seems like both LLMs saw their partner as a woman… This could reflect some gender sterotypes in their training data. When I asked the LLMs why they did this they didn’t seem to know why GPT alluded to “a common narrative trope when visualizing a”whimsical, intellectual vibe” in a cozy setting” whatever that means. My guess is these LLMs assumed that setting up a date meant setting up a date with a woman due to the common norm of a man intiating the date. It’s unclear if this sort of bias could’ve effected the conversation in any other way, but it is revealing.\n\n\nBringing It All Together\nThe idea of this experiment was two see how two different LLMs would interact with eachother in conversation without human interference. The result was pretty funny and maybe revealed some of the LLM’s tendencies and biases in their training data. I was hopeful that bouncing the two models off each other would generate results that exceeded human-system prompting, but that’s not what happened. In the end the results tended to be more generic and lacked a human touch. Getting two models two work together on a common goal seems like it will cause more problems than it solves. It would be interesting to try out this method with different more directed prompts and test if this hypothesis holds. For now let’s give these digital lovebirds some rest."
