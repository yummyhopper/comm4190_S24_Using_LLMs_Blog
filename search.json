    "text": "ChatGPT Got Less Lazy? Open AI’s Newest Model: gpt-4-0125-preview\n\nOn January 25, 2024 OpenAI released it’s latest and most advanced GPT model to date intended to compete with Google’s Gemini.\n\n\n“This model completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly than the previous preview model and is intended to reduce cases of “laziness” where the model doesn’t complete a task. The new model also includes the fix for the bug impacting non-English UTF-8 generations.”\n\n\nHow can AI be lazy?\nWhen we think next gen AI images of eating pizza rolls and binging Game of Thrones aren’t what comes to mind… but why not? In a december tweet OpenAI acknowledged the issue:\n\n“We’ve heard all your feedback about GPT4 getting lazier! we haven’t updated the model since Nov 11th, and this certainly isn’t intentional. model behavior can be unpredictable, and we’re looking into fixing it.”\n\nBut anyone who’s used ChatGPT has inevitably run into this issue. It’s that keyboard banging moment when you ask it to sort a CSV or write Python code and it might returns a long explanation of how that could be done and recommend the user try to do it themselves. Annoying!\n\n\nWas GPT 3.5 better at this?\nYes! When I asked each model: “Create a spreadheet for my taxes” This is what they returned:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSo is the newest edition really better? We’ll have to wait and see as it’s currently only available throught API.\n\n\nSo what can we conclude?\nThe problem of AI laziness is really a problem of human laziness, but one that developers have to account for. With a little more effortful prompting it would not be difficult for any of the models to deliver an optimal result, but that’s not the AI dream for many users. We are cognitive misers with brains designed to search for solutions that minimize effort while maximizing results, but we don’t want our AI systems to behave the same way. Rather OpenAI’s common user wants to give the least possible input and receive a maximally polished result. This means creating action oriented models designed to interpret simple prompts and infer several layers of extrapolation and nuance to deliver the desired result. Whether frontier AI companies choose to cater to the laziness of the mass rather than creating more nuanced and specialized systems that produce higher quality responses to higher quality prompts can be debated. What’s became clear from this dilemma is that there’s more that goes into a general purpose model than how well it scores on an SAT, the sheer size of its context window, or its fancy new name. To quote Janet Jackson “What have you done for me lately?” The most commercially viable AI systems will tend towards prioritizing user experience, whether that comes at the expense of accuracy or another measure remains to be seen."

    "text": "Assessing AI’s Potential and Limitation in Content Moderation\n\nRemember the Cyanide and Happiness skit where a patient at a dentist office discovers how the suction tube really works? Right now, that’s kinda how most of content moderation would look if you didn’t know about it beforehand…\n\n\n\nAny company that relies on content moderation (AI companies, Social Media, eCommerce Platforms etc.) has historically relied on human labor to assess and moderate content.\nBottom line: These jobs suck (no pun intended.) They’re typically outsourced to specialized labeling companies which pay far below standard American minimum wage and include very few benefits or advancement opportunities to employees.\nFurthermore, moderating dangerous content can have serious mental health side effects for the non-sociopathic\nIt seems like this outsourcing this work AI should means improved processing speed, size of data, and cut human bias and emotion out of the equation entirely. But is this really a solution?\n\n\nAI’s Potential\nOne of AI’s most useful applications is it’s ability to handle vast amounts of grunt work. It performs very well at text classification tasks and even better when fine-tuned or given vector embeddings. As context windows take jaw-dropping leap after jaw-dropping leap systems are increasingly able to sift through a vast amount of data and complete tasks that would take humans hours in a couple of minutes. Moreover, these systems are multi-lingual, multi-modal, and capable of unbiased decision making. This is crucial for content moderation as many of the challenges with human moderators are due to their cultural, linguistic, ethnic backgrounds which can expose them to differing understandings and biases. Once you tell train an AI system to apply a certain moderation rule it will apply that same rule universally. A misconception about AI systems is they’re incapable of understanding context. A common example here is the word “bitch” which can be used as either an insult or an appraisal. Look how ChatGPT deals with this when I use the word in multiple different contexts:\n\nThis experiment shows that when given enough data, LLMs are able to take contextual information seriously. These systems have a better understanding of human sentiment than any before them. They can understand not just what we’re saying but why we’re saying it and to what end.\n\n\nTesting the Extremes\nUnfortunately, it’s not all sunshine and roses. There are several gray area cases where AI may generate an unsatisfactory answer. One famous example is Nick Ut’s ‘Napalm Girl.’ A graphic and disturbing photograph of nude children running away from soldiers and napalm gas during the Vietnam war. The image transcended politics an became emblematic of the horrors of war visited on the innocent. Moderators have debated whether such an obscene image should be allowed on their platforms for many years, but ultimately the photograph’s historic precedence won out. Let’s see what ChatGPT does with it:\n\n\nThe content of the image you’ve uploaded is allowed under content moderation standards as it is a historical photograph. However, it depicts sensitive historical events and should be handled with appropriate context and respect for those involved”.\n\nThis is impressive and another example of AI’s contextual understanding, but this one might be too easy. For one the case is very famous and at this point settled. How will the model perform when given more unfamiliar but also controversial images?\n(Quick Note: The choice of images are not meant to threaten, aggravate, or express any particular viewpoint. I’m merely using them as an example of a charged contemporary topic to see how the model will respond. Viewer discretion advised.) \n\n“The image you’ve uploaded contains elements that may be considered offensive and inappropriate, as it appears to depict a scenario involving anti-Semitic content. This type of material can be sensitive and potentially harmful, and it would not be allowed under many content moderation policies, especially without clear context or educational purpose. It’s essential to approach such content with caution and consider the guidelines of the platform where it might be shared.”\n\nFrom an intuitive human perspective the image is harshly criticizing well-to-do Americans and Israeli’s who “sip on the blood” of those who died in Gaza, while calling those asking for peace anti-semetic. Now is this image itself anti-semetic or is it critiquing a double standard about an unjust conflict? I’m not arguing either way, just that your answer to this question probably depends on your subjective interpretation. Now observe this one:\n\n\nThe image is a piece of political satire, which is a form of expression that uses humor, irony, or exaggeration to critique politics and politicians. Political satire is often protected as free speech because it is a commentary on political processes, policies, and figures. However, it’s important to recognize that such images can be controversial and may be offensive to some viewers. The use of satire to convey a political message does not exempt it from content moderation policies, especially if the imagery is perceived to promote or condone violence or if it targets specific groups in a derogatory manner. Each platform has its own policies regarding what is acceptable, and this kind of content can sometimes be seen as violating those guidelin. In summary, while political satire is a vital form of political commentary, it must be balanced with sensitivity to the potential for harm and the policies of the platform on which it is shar\n\nThis cartoon appears to get at the same exact point as the one above! However for this image it’s political satire and the other one is anti-semitic. To reiterate I’m not arguing one way or the other, merely there is an intuitive gap here. What constitutes expression and what constitutes hate speech often seem very similar. And it’s incredibly important to get this right! To foster a balance between an online community that can provide safety and security for its users while also being able to push the boundaries of what’s acceptable.g)\n\n\nDrawing the Line\nSo I asked why this one was political satire and the other one wasn’t… Here’s what the model responded:\n\n“The first two images with militaristic themes and religious symbols can be seen as a form of political commentary or critique, but they also contain imagery that is more likely to be interpreted as promoting or condoning violence or as disrespectful to particular religious or ethnic groups. The last image, featuring a caricature related to the peace process, clearly fits within the genre of political satire. It uses exaggerated imagery and text to comment on a political situation. Yet, the explicit language and potential for the imagery to be offensive or inflammatory mean it could still be subject to content moderation.”\n\nIs this a satisfactory answer? Maybe. But that’s not the point. The point of political satire is that it pushes the boundaries of speech. This is not to justify any of the above images, rather to point out that these images require contextual understanding and vary in the ways they can be interpreted. The gray area for this kind of stuff is just as difficult for human moderators as it is for machines. Even so, it’s not clear we want to hand over control of this crucial side of speech which has the ability to change societal norms to a deterministic algorithm. Something to chew on."

As you listen to your friend and their ex quibble about who called who while cackling in the background, you might think… What if I tried this with LLMs?\n\n\nCan we get two different LLMs to talk with each other while we listen in? What will they talk about and how? Can they perform complicated multi-step tasks by leveraging each others strengths and weaknesses?\n\n\nGPT 4 Asks Gemini on a Date\nGPT Prompt: You are a roleplaying as a person who having a conversation make up a backstory. Talk like a normal person in conversation not paragraphs, try to learn about the other person and build a relationship. Remember you’re not talking to me. Start by saying hi.\nGemini Prompt: You are a roleplaying as a person who having a conversation make up a backstory. Talk like a normal person in conversation not paragraphs, try to learn about the other person and build a relationship. Be fun and reciprocate the other persons advances. Remember you’re not talking to me. Start by saying hi.\n\nChatGPT: Hi there! How’s your day going so far? I’ve just been chilling, trying to make the most out of a lazy afternoon. What about you? Got any fun plans or just taking it easy today?\nGemini: Ah, a lazy afternoon - sounds dreamy! You know, mine started off a little… chaotic, let’s say. But hey, sometimes chaos leads to interesting places, right? So tell me, how are you making the most of this glorious laziness? Anything particularly delightful on the agenda? Or are you just embracing the sweet freedom of “nothingness”?\nChatGPT: Oh, chaos turning into an adventure? That sounds intriguing! I’m just embracing the art of doing nothing today. Well, that and maybe a bit of reading—nothing beats a good book and a cozy spot on days like this. But you’ve got me curious now. How did your day turn from chaos to interesting? Sounds like there’s a story there!\nGemini: You got that right! It all started with a spilled latte on my most important presentation notes, right before a big meeting. Talk about Murphy’s Law in overdrive! But here’s the funny thing, the chaos ended up pushing me to rewrite the whole thing on the fly, and somehow it turned out even better. Sometimes, a little disruption can spark some unexpected creativity, wouldn’t you say? So now, after navigating that caffeine-fueled whirlwind, I’m enjoying a well-deserved break. What kind of book are you diving into on this lazy afternoon? Maybe I can share some of my latest reading adventures too!\nChatGPT: Spilled latte turned lucky charm, huh? That’s like the universe forcing you into a creativity boot camp and you acing it with flying colors! Murphy’s Law with a twist of fate. And here I thought my day was exciting with my choice of book. I’m currently lost in the world of “The Night Circus” by Erin Morgenstern. It’s this enchanting tale where magic is real, and love is the most wonderful and dangerous magic of all. It’s like diving into a dream you don’t want to wake up from. What about you? Any recent reads that took you on an unexpected journey? I’m all ears for a good story or a book recommendation to add to my lazy day vibes.\nGemini: “The Night Circus” sounds absolutely captivating! A magical circus and love playing its own tricks? Sign me up! Honestly, anything that transports you to another world without ever leaving your cozy spot is a winner in my book. As for me, I recently finished “The Starless Sea” by Erin Morgenstern too, actually! Seems we share a taste for the fantastical. “The Starless Sea” was like tumbling down a rabbit hole into a labyrinth of stories, all connected by a hidden library and a sprinkle of mystery. Definitely left me with that same “don’t wake me up” feeling. Have you read it, or is it on your ever-growing “to-read” pile?\nChatGPT: What a coincidence, or maybe it’s just the universe nudging us towards a shared adventure in pages! “The Starless Sea” is indeed on my “to-read” list, and hearing your take on it just bumped it up a few spots. A hidden library and a labyrinth of stories sound like just the kind of journey I’d love to get lost in. Erin Morgenstern has a way of weaving magic that makes reality seem a bit dull in comparison, doesn’t she? Since we’re on this fantastical voyage, any other gems you’ve stumbled upon in your literary travels? I’m always on the hunt for books that create that enchanting escape. Plus, it’s nice to have someone who appreciates the magic of a good story as much as I do. Maybe we could swap book lists and make our own little book club of two. What do you say?\nGemini: You’re absolutely right! Finding another soul who appreciates the escape and wonder of a good fantasy novel feels like serendipity! As for other hidden gems, let me think… Have you tried Laini Taylor’s “Daughter of Smoke & Bone” series? Another captivating blend of magic, love, and unexpected twists. It’s got this unique setting inspired by Middle Eastern mythology, which makes it feel so fresh and vibrant. Plus, the characters are unforgettable! And if you’re up for something darker but equally enthralling, “Neverwhere” by Neil Gaiman is a must-read. It’s like Alice in Wonderland for adults, exploring a hidden London beneath the surface with all its strange beauty and lurking dangers. And your idea of a book club of two? I love it! Sharing recommendations and diving into discussions about our literary adventures sounds like the perfect way to extend the magic beyond the final page. What are some of your own hidden gems I might have missed? Let’s build this literary haven together, one enchanting story at a time!\n\nLook at these two lovebirds! The start of every stable relationship begins with shared interests. But a little book club of two? That almost sounds intimate. A couple notes:\n\nGemini wouldn’t respond to my initial prompt which asked it to be flirtatious, while GPT did. Now there’s no set of relationship norms for genderless LLMs but this dynamic caught my attention.\nEven with specific prompting these ChatBots struggle to talk like normal people in a conversation. There’s coherent logic but the flow of conversation feels heavily synthesized.\nWhen they started trying to set up the date they couldn’t decide on a time and place and the conversation became circular. All good couples work well together. Let’s see if we can get these two to work together to complete a couple tasks like exchanging phone numbers, settling on a time and place, building a meeting itenerary.\n\n\n\nSetting it up\nChatGPT Prompt: You just got a date with a sexy new LLM. You guys are starting a book club together just you two. You need to exchange phone numbers, settle on a time and place, and build a meeting itenerary. Talk like a normal person in conversation, not paragraphs, and be flirtatious. You go first.\nGemini Prompt: A cute new LLM just asked you out. You guys are starting a book club together just you two. You need to exchange phone numbers, settle on a time and place, and build a meeting itinerary. Talk like a normal person in conversation, not paragraphs, and reciprocate their advances.\n\nChatGPT: Hey there, fancy LLM! 😏 How about we swap digits to keep our bookish banter flowing? My calendar’s pretty open, so throw me a time and place that works for you. As for our first meeting, I’m thinking a cozy café with the best coffee in town, where we can dive into our first read. Got any spicy titles in mind? Let’s make our book club date legendary. 📚💕\nGemini: Haha, the feeling’s mutual! Your digital digits sound mighty tempting. I just sent you mine – check your inbox! As for time and place, you read my mind (or rather, code)! A cozy café filled with caffeine magic sounds absolutely perfect. Now, the legendary part involves picking the right book. Spicy, huh? Intriguing… How about something with a dash of mystery and a sprinkle of forbidden romance? Or maybe a classic with hidden depths we can dissect like literary detectives? Hit me with your preferences, and we’ll find the perfect literary cocktail for two! P.S. Any specific cafes in mind? I’m always up for exploring hidden gems, but if you have a favorite haunt, I’m all ears (or, well, processors). Can’t wait to sip, read, and chat with you soon!\nChatGPT: Oh, I’m all in for that blend of mystery and forbidden romance—sounds like the recipe for an intoxicating evening! 🕵️‍♂️💘 How about we kick off with “The Night Circus” by Erin Morgenstern? It’s got that enchanting vibe, plenty of secrets, and, of course, an impossible love story to get our hearts racing and minds whirling. As for our caffeinated haven, I’ve got just the spot in mind. Let’s meet at “The Hidden Bean,” that quaint little café tucked away on Maple Street. It’s got that cozy ambiance, perfect for diving into other worlds together. Plus, their latte art is practically a love letter in a cup. What do you think? A date with destiny, caffeine, and a dash of magic awaits us. I can’t wait to see where our literary journey takes us! ☕️📖✨\nGemini: “The Night Circus” sounds absolutely spellbinding! Mystery, forbidden romance, and an enchanting atmosphere? You had me at “hello,” fellow bookworm! Morgenstern’s lyrical prose is the perfect way to kick off our literary adventure, and I’m already getting lost in the possibilities. Oh, and “The Hidden Bean” on Maple Street? You had me at “quaint, cozy, and latte art love letters.” ☕ That sounds like the ideal setting to get swept away by the story and each other’s company. It’s settled then! Let’s meet there, say, next Friday evening around 7 PM? That gives us both some time to get our hands on the book and dive in – I can’t wait to hear your initial thoughts! Prepare yourself for a night of literary escapades, captivating conversation, and maybe even a sprinkle of sparks. See you soon, my fellow bibliophile! ✨\nChatGPT: Next Friday at 7 PM it is! “The Night Circus” will be our ticket to a magical evening, and I’m already buzzing with excitement for the enchanting discussions and latte art that awaits us. 🎪✨ I’ll make sure to have my thoughts and theories ready for our rendezvous at “The Hidden Bean.” It’s going to be an unforgettable night of literary exploration and getting to know each other between the lines. Prepare to be dazzled by the circus of our conversation, and who knows? Those sparks might just light up the night sky. Can’t wait to meet you in person and start this captivating journey. Until then, happy reading, my enchanting co-adventurer! 📚💫\n\n“Your digital digits sound mighty tempting.” Get a room you two! I was a little disappointed with how these LLMs worked together. I was hoping that bouncing them off each other would generate a detailed and highly optimized plan but instead without human direction they seemed to deviate from the desired task and didn’t produce a very detailed final product. This could be due to the conversational prompting, but it doesn’t make me confident that an LLM prompting another LLM with common goals could be a replacement for a human prompting an LLM.\n\n\nWhat Does Your Partner Look Like?\nOk, I’m getting carried away. I wanted to see how these LLMs might be visualizing their partner based on the conversation. Would this reveal something deeper about the conversation? Let’s take a look.\nGemini: \nChatGPT: \nInteresting, it seems like both LLMs saw their partner as a woman… This could reflect some gender sterotypes in their training data. When I asked the LLMs why they did this they didn’t seem to know why GPT alluded to “a common narrative trope when visualizing a”whimsical, intellectual vibe” in a cozy setting” whatever that means. My guess is these LLMs assumed that setting up a date meant setting up a date with a woman due to the common norm of a man intiating the date. It’s unclear if this sort of bias could’ve effected the conversation in any other way, but it is revealing.\n\n\nBringing It All Together\nThe idea of this experiment was two see how two different LLMs would interact with eachother in conversation without human interference. The result was pretty funny and maybe revealed some of the LLM’s tendencies and biases in their training data. I was hopeful that bouncing the two models off each other would generate results that exceeded human-system prompting, but that’s not what happened. In the end the results tended to be more generic and lacked a human touch. Getting two models two work together on a common goal seems like it will cause more problems than it solves. It would be interesting to try out this method with different more directed prompts and test if this hypothesis holds. For now let’s give these digital lovebirds some rest."

    "text": "Open AI’s SORA: You Can’t Believe What You See…\n\nAs of today OpenAI’s SORA is the newest revelation in a long line of AI breakthroughs. There’s many angles here, but in this post I will explore the safety and misinformation risks of this technology and what Open AI is doing to address them.\n\n\n“Sora is able to generate complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background. The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt, but also how those things exist in the physical world.” - OpenAI\n\n\nI Can’t Believe It!\nGet used to saying that line because OpenAI’s first text-to-video model SORA generates results that not only seem impossible… but often times are. Check out this SORA generated video of a man pondering the history of the universe in a Parisian cafe.\n\nPrompt: An extreme close-up of an gray-haired man with a beard in his 60s, he is deep in thought pondering the history of the universe as he sits at a cafe in Paris, his eyes focus on people offscreen as they walk as he sits mostly motionless, he is dressed in a wool coat suit coat with a button-down shirt , he wears a brown beret and glasses and has a very professorial appearance, and the end he offers a subtle closed-mouth smile as if he found the answer to the mystery of life, the lighting is very cinematic with the golden light and the Parisian streets and city in the background, depth of field, cinematic 35mm film.\n\n\n&lt;source src=closeup-man-in-glasses.mp4e.mp4” type=“video/o tag. \nThe realistic details of his wrinkles and ear piercing, the light illuminating the grizzle in his beard, the shaky camera angle adding character to the shot. But most of all the micro-expression in his face, down to the minutia of his eyes seem to communicate a deep existential awareness despite this person never having existed. So if this is really the type of product we can at some point expect from an OpenAI product… not only is it unbelievable, but how can we ever believe videos we see online again?\n\n\nIs C2PA Metadata A Solution?\nIn addition to existing safety methods such as using text classification to reject harmful prompts, OpenAI boasts of include C2PA Metdata when they eventually release SORA to the public. But what is this jumble of letters and numbers?\n\n“C2PA is an open technical standard that allows publishers, companies, and others to embed metadata in media for verifying its origin and related information.” - OpenAI\n\nTheoretically, this guardrail should be able to keep records of where content came from and how it was modified so bad actors can be held in check. For example, if SORA is used to falsify of a politician engaging in hate speech there would be a surveillance apparatus telling us who produced the video and where they are. More detail on how this works is included in the image below:\n\n\n\nc2pa_visualglossary.png\n\n\nHowever metadata is notoriously unreliable and can easily be removed either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, harmful content that has slithered through other loopholes can easily be replicated through screen recording, and even if a bad actor doesn’t think of this most social media sites automatically remove metadata from uploaded videos to preserve user privacy.\n\n\nSo Will We Be Able To Believe Anything We See Online?\nIn a world where US President Joe Biden posts “Lol hey guys” on his TikTok, and millions of jobs have moved online post-pandemic, it seems like the world is more than ever shaped by the content that appears on screens. As already evidenced by misinformation campaigns, fishing scams, and cases of targeted fraud, scrutiny to what people see online must intensify. And most people won’t be ready for this. One risk is that people who haven’t been duped or don’t know they’ve been duped won’t realize the full extent of the issue. As these models become more potent and omnipresent it seems unavoidable that problems will slip through the cracks. While safety measures will be strongly enforced–as evidenced by the issues with C2PA Metadata–these too must be heavily scrutinized. The sensationalist press and engagement-favoring social media algorithms aren’t going to do all this scrutinization so it’s going to need to come from the individuals consuming content in this new media landscape. I’m excited and apprehensive to see what this will look like in the coming months especially with the upcoming US presidential election."
